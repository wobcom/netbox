# Change Information

A change represents a change to the network or its documentation.

It is necessary to create a change for any and all edits to the state of
Netbox. Changes should have a title and a change number as found in
[TOPdesk](https://topdesk.service.wobcom.de). A change in TOPdesk is
*necessary* for a change in NetBox for ITIL compliance reasons, unless it is an
emergency change (see the checkbox at the bottom) of the form.

Please donâ€™t mark a regular change as an emergency.
