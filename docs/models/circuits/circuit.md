# Circuits

A circuit represents a single _physical_ link connecting exactly two endpoints. (A circuit with more than two endpoints is a virtual circuit, which is not currently supported by NetBox.) Each circuit belongs to a provider and must be assigned a circuit ID which is unique to that provider.
