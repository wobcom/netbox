# Providers

A provider is any entity which provides some form of connectivity. While this obviously includes carriers which offer Internet and private transit service, it might also include Internet exchange (IX) points and even organizations with whom you peer directly.

Each provider may be assigned an autonomous system number (ASN), an account number, and relevant contact information.
