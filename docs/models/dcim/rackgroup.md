# Rack Groups

Racks can be arranged into groups. As with sites, how you choose to designate rack groups will depend on the nature of your organization. For example, if each site represents a campus, each group might represent a building within a campus. If each site represents a building, each rack group might equate to a floor or room.

Each rack group must be assigned to a parent site. Hierarchical recursion of rack groups is not currently supported.

The name and facility ID of each rack within a group must be unique. (Racks not assigned to the same rack group may have identical names and/or facility IDs.)
