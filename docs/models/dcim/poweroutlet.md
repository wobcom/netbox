## Power Outlets

Power outlets represent the ports on a PDU that supply power to other devices. Power outlets are downstream-facing towards power ports. A power outlet can be associated with a power port on the same device and a feed leg (i.e. in a case of a three-phase supply). This indicates which power port supplies power to a power outlet.
