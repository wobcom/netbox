## Rear Ports

Like front ports, rear ports are pass-through ports which represent the end of a particular cable segment in a path. Each rear port is defined with a number of positions: rear ports with more than one position can be mapped to multiple front ports. This can be useful for modeling instances where multiple paths share a common cable (for example, six different fiber connections sharing a 12-strand MPO cable).

Note that front and rear ports need not necessarily reside on the actual front or rear device face. This terminology is used primarily to distinguish between the two components in a pass-through port pairing.
