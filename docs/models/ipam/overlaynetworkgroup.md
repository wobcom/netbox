# Overlay Network Groups

Overlay network groups are a way to group overlay networks together. They
themselves do not configure the group members, and to add an overlay network to
a group you will have to change the configuration of the overlay network
itself.

The only required properties of the overlay network are name and slug (where
the slug can be automatically generated from the name). Optionally, a group can
be tied to a certain site, much like a single overlay network can.
