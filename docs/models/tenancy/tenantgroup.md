# Tenant Groups

Tenants can be organized by custom groups. For instance, you might create one group called "Customers" and one called "Acquisitions." The assignment of tenants to groups is optional.

Tenant groups may be nested to achieve a multi-level hierarchy. For example, you might have a group called "Customers" containing subgroups of individual tenants grouped by product or account team.
