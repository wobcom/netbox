# BGP Communities

BGP communities model communities, which can be described as information
attached to BGP routes, not unlike labels or tags.

In a NetBox context, such a community has a human-readable name, an internal
name (which is what the device will end up seeing), and a description for the
operator. It works together with other models in the configuration namespace
to model the BGP setup on our devices.
