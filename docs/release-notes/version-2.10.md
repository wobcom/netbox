## v2.10.0 (2020-12-14)

**NOTE:** This release completely removes support for embedded graphs.

**NOTE:** The Django templating language (DTL) is no longer supported for export templates. Ensure that all export templates use Jinja2 before upgrading.

### New Features

#### Route Targets ([#259](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/issues/259))

This release introduces support for modeling L3VPN route targets, which can be used to control the redistribution of advertised prefixes among VRFs. Each VRF may be assigned one or more route targets in the import and/or export direction. Like VRFs, route targets may be assigned to tenants and support tag assignment.

#### REST API Bulk Deletion ([#3436](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/issues/3436))

The REST API now supports the bulk deletion of objects of the same type in a single request. Send a `DELETE` HTTP request to the list to the model's list endpoint (e.g. `/api/dcim/sites/`) with a list of JSON objects specifying the numeric ID of each object to be deleted. For example, to delete sites with IDs 10, 11, and 12, issue the following request:

```no-highlight
curl -s -X DELETE \
-H "Authorization: Token $TOKEN" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
http://netbox/api/dcim/sites/ \
--data '[{"id": 10}, {"id": 11}, {"id": 12}]'
```

#### REST API Bulk Update ([#4882](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/issues/4882))

Similar to bulk deletion, the REST API also now supports bulk updates. Send a `PUT` or `PATCH` HTTP request to the list to the model's list endpoint (e.g. `/api/dcim/sites/`) with a list of JSON objects specifying the numeric ID of each object and the attribute(s) to be updated. For example, to set a description for sites with IDs 10 and 11, issue the following request:

```no-highlight
curl -s -X PATCH \
-H "Authorization: Token $TOKEN" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
http://netbox/api/dcim/sites/ \
--data '[{"id": 10, "description": "Foo"}, {"id": 11, "description": "Bar"}]'
```

#### Reimplementation of Custom Fields ([#4878](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/issues/4878))

NetBox v2.10 introduces a completely overhauled approach to custom fields. Whereas previous versions used CustomFieldValue instances to store values, custom field data is now stored directly on each model instance as JSON data and may be accessed using the `cf` property:

```python
>>> site = Site.objects.first()
>>> site.cf
{'site_code': 'US-RAL01'}
>>> site.cf['foo'] = 'ABC'
>>> site.full_clean()
>>> site.save()
>>> site = Site.objects.first()
>>> site.cf
{'foo': 'ABC', 'site_code': 'US-RAL01'}
```

Additionally, custom selection field choices are now defined on the CustomField model within the admin UI, which greatly simplifies working with choice values.

#### Improved Cable Trace Performance ([#4900](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/issues/4900))

All end-to-end cable paths are now cached using the new CablePath backend model. This allows NetBox to now immediately return the complete path originating from any endpoint directly from the database, rather than having to trace each cable recursively. It also resolves some systemic validation issues present in the original implementation.

**Note:** As part of this change, cable traces will no longer traverse circuits: A circuit termination will be considered the origin or destination of an end-to-end path.
